## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you will need:

- MongoDB Database (Local or MongoDB Atlas)
- A Gmail account to send emails via a third-party service

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/eyadbenaamer/Socially
   $ cd Socially
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**

   You will need to create `.env` files in both the `client` and `server` directories.

   - **Client `.env` (located in `/client/.env`):**

     ```env
     REACT_APP_APP_URL=http://localhost:5000
     ```

   - **Server `.env` (located in `/server/.env`):**

     ```env
     APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
     API_URL=http://localhost:5000
     GMAIL_USER=<your Gmail>
     GMAIL_PASSWORD=<your email password>
     COOKIE_SECRET=<your cookie secret key>
     JWT_SECRET=<your JWT secret key>
     DATABASE_URL=<your MongoDB URL>
     PORT=5000
     TOKEN_EXPIRATION=10d
     ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   Open two terminal windows or tabs:

   - In the first terminal, navigate to the client directory, install dependencies, and start the client:

     ```bash
     $ cd client
     $ npm i --force
     $ npm start
     ```

   - In the second terminal, navigate to the server directory, install dependencies, and start the server:

     ```bash
     $ cd server
     $ npm i
     $ npm start
     ```

### Usage

Once both the client and server are running, the application should be available at:

- **Client (Frontend):** `http://localhost:3000`
- **Server (Backend):** `http://localhost:5000`

You can now use the app locally.
